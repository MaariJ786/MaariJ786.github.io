               <h2>My Name is Ma'arij Anwar</h2>
			   			   <i><img src="img/5.jpg"></i>
               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">My name is Maâ€™arij Anwar. I am a 15-year-old aspiring dev ops engineer and an enthusiastic CGI Artist. At the moment I am studying computer science which helps with programming and computer programming skills. In my spare time I like to make CGI art for example pieces please contact me. I am very experienced in graphics as I have made my own movies and worked with professional Hollywood studios like Axis animation helping with professional animations. I normally work with professional software like Maya and adobe to create my masterpieces. I have them published in my website. I have experience with technical lighting and with creating 3d pieces using Maya Mud-box 2017. I have a lot of experience with Python as it is the main IDLE we use in computer science. I have also worked with Ruby, Java and py-charm to make my projects. My main website was created by me using java html and CSS. I like to work as a part of a team and like to collaborate and share my skills with others. I realize that I have certain strengths and working as a team means I can share my strengths and get help from peers for my weaknesses. I also like to critically analyze problems and use decomposition to solve them. This is helpful as it creates smaller problems that I can solve to help solve the big problem that I am faced with. I use decomposition for my projects such as making games on python and scratch and my CGI projects. Soon I will be applying for my CCNA and CCNP exam which hopefully I will take very soon. My favorite subjects are
Maths and computing both which help me with my graphical CGI skills.


			   </p>
			   
			   <p> I also love sciences and am thinking of going into the field of medicine and work in the future as a neurosurgeon. I like to learn about the facinating brain. in todays society and information on science we know very little about the main thing thats is the motherboard of us humans. I am very good at chemistry, biology and physics and will hopefully become a neurosurgeon.
			   I like to read books about neurology and find it very interesting and i am learning alot of which i didnt know.
