               <h1>Computational Thinking</h1>

               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center"> Computers can be used to help us solve problems. However, before a problem can be tackled, the problem itself and the ways in which it could be solved need to be understood.
Computational thinking allows us to do this.<br>
Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions. We can then present these solutions in a way that a computer, a human, or both, can understand. 
			   </p>
			   
			   <p>
			   There are four key techniques (cornerstones) to computational thinking:<br>
decomposition - breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts <br>
pattern recognition – looking for similarities among and within problems <br>
abstraction – focusing on the important information only, ignoring irrelevant detail<br> 
algorithms - developing a step-by-step solution to the problem, or the rules to follow to solve the problem<br> 
Each cornerstone is as important as the others. They are like legs on a table - if one leg is missing, the table will probably collapse. Correctly applying all four techniques will help when programming a computer.
			   </P>
			   <h2>Decomposition</h2>
			   <p>Decomposition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed individually, as they are simpler to work with.</P>
			   
			   <p>If a problem is not decomposed, it is much harder to solve. Dealing with many different stages all at once is much more difficult than breaking a problem down into a number of smaller problems and solving each one, one at a time. Breaking the problem down into smaller parts means that each smaller problem can be examined in more detail.<br>
Similarly, trying to understand how a complex system works is easier using decomposition. For example, understanding how a bicycle works is more straightforward if the whole bike is separated into smaller parts and each part is examined to see how it works in more detail.</p>


<h2>Pattern Recognision</h2>
<p>When we decompose a complex problem we often find patterns among the smaller problems we create. The patterns are similarities or characteristics that some of the problems share.<br>
Pattern recognition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves finding the similarities or patterns among small, decomposed problems that can help us solve more complex problems more efficiently.</P>

<p>
Imagine that we want to draw a series of cats.<br> 
All cats share common characteristics. Among other things they all have eyes, tails and fur. They also like to eat fish and make meowing sounds.<br>
Because we know that all cats have eyes, tails and fur, we can make a good attempt at drawing a cat, simply by including these common characteristics. <br>
In computational thinking, these characteristics are known as patterns. Once we know how to describe one cat we can describe others, simply by following this pattern. The only things that are different are the specifics:<br>
one cat may have green eyes, a long tail and black fur <br>
another cat may have yellow eyes, a short tail and striped fur <br>




<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>
Abstraction is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves filtering out – essentially, ignoring - the characteristics that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do.
</P>
<p>

In computational thinking, when we decompose problems, we then look for patterns among and within the smaller problems that make up the complex problem.<br>
Abstraction is the process of filtering out – ignoring - the characteristics of patterns that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. It is also the filtering out of specific details. From this we create a representation (idea) of what we are trying to solve.
</p>
<p>
In pattern recognition we looked at the problem of having to draw a series of cats.
We noted that all cats have general characteristics, which are common to all cats, eg eyes, a tail, fur, a liking for fish and the ability to make meowing sounds. In addition, each cat has specific characteristics, such as black fur, a long tail, green eyes, a love of salmon, and a loud meow. These details are known as specifics.<br>
In order to draw a basic cat, we do need to know that it has a tail, fur and eyes. These characteristics are relevant. We don't need to know what sound a cat makes or that it likes fish. These characteristics are irrelevant and can be filtered out. We do need to know that a cat has a tail, fur and eyes, but we don't need to know what size and colour these are. These specifics can be filtered out.<br>
From the general characteristics we have (tail, fur, eyes) we can build a basic idea of a cat, ie what a cat basically looks like. Once we know what a cat looks like we can describe how to draw a basic cat.</p>

<p>
Abstraction allows us to create a general idea of what the problem is and how to solve it. The process instructs us to remove all specific detail, and any patterns that will not help us solve our problem. This helps us form our idea of the problem. This idea is known as a ‘model’.<br>
If we don’t abstract we may end up with the wrong solution to the problem we are trying to solve. With our cat example, if we didn’t abstract we might think that all cats have long tails and short fur. Having abstracted, we know that although cats have tails and fur, not all tails are long and not all fur is short. In this case, abstraction has helped us to form a clearer model of a cat.</p>
